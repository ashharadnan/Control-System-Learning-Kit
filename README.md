# Control-System-Learning-Kit
A kit designed to engage students with the concept of control systems: model identification, controller design, controller tuning, etc

This system uses an STM32 F401CCU6 microcontroller at its core and allows the operation of different tests and the implementation of P, PI, and PID controllers. The original implementation involves a plant with two tanks with free flow; a non-linear system. The project can be generalised for a variety of other plants as well.
